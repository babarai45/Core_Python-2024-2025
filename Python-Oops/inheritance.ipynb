    "# Great! Since you've mastered inheritance in Python, Iâ€™ll give you 10 challenging problems that will test your understanding of complex inheritance concepts, along with 5 real-life project ideas to apply your knowledge.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# ### **10 Complex Challenges (Covering Advanced Inheritance Concepts)**\n",
    "# \n",
    "# 1. **Multiple Inheritance with Method Resolution Order (MRO)**:\n",
    "#    - Create a set of classes where a child class inherits from two or more parent classes with overlapping method names. Analyze how Python resolves the method calls using the C3 linearization (MRO).\n",
    "#    - **Hint**: Use the `super()` function and the `__mro__` attribute to track method resolution.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# 2. **Diamond Problem (Multiple Inheritance)**:\n",
    "#    - Implement a diamond inheritance structure where a grandchild class inherits from two classes, both of which inherit from the same base class. Ensure that methods in the grandchild class call the base class's methods in the correct order.\n",
    "#    - **Hint**: Use the `super()` method to control the calling sequence of parent classes.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# 3. **Abstract Base Classes (ABC) in a Hierarchical Inheritance Structure**:\n",
    "#    - Create an abstract base class (ABC) with one or more abstract methods, then create subclasses that implement those abstract methods. Make the design such that some subclasses also inherit from multiple abstract base classes.\n",
    "#    - **Hint**: Use Pythonâ€™s `abc` module to define abstract methods.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# 4. **Override Parent Class Methods and Use `super()` Efficiently**:\n",
    "#    - Create a class hierarchy where child classes override parent class methods but also use `super()` to extend the parent class's functionality.\n",
    "#    - **Challenge**: In the middle of the hierarchy, add a class that overrides methods but alters their behavior completely before calling `super()`.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# 5. **Dynamic Method Overriding**:\n",
    "#    - Define a class where a method is dynamically overridden during runtime. Create a situation where the behavior of the method depends on external conditions, and this method is overridden in the subclass.\n",
    "#    - **Hint**: Use `setattr()` to modify class methods dynamically.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# 6. **Polymorphism with Multiple Levels of Inheritance**:\n",
    "#    - Create a scenario where you have three or more levels of inheritance, with methods being overridden at each level. Demonstrate how polymorphism works when the object of the last level is used to call methods defined at various levels.\n",
    "#    - **Hint**: Implement both method overloading and overriding.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# 7. **Mixins and Code Reusability**:\n",
    "#    - Design a system using mixins where multiple subclasses inherit from mixins that add specific functionality (e.g., logging, validation). Demonstrate how mixins can be reused across different class hierarchies.\n",
    "#    - **Hint**: Mixins should be small, focused classes that provide one feature.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# 8. **Inheritance with Class and Instance Attributes**:\n",
    "#    - Create a class hierarchy where the parent class defines class-level and instance-level attributes. In the child class, change some of these attributes and see how they interact.\n",
    "#    - **Hint**: Explore how class attributes are shared and how instance attributes override them.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# 9. **Factory Pattern Using Inheritance**:\n",
    "#    - Implement a factory pattern where a factory class dynamically creates instances of different subclasses based on user input. Each subclass should inherit from a common parent class but perform a unique task.\n",
    "#    - **Hint**: Use `__new__()` or metaclasses to control instance creation.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# 10. **Cyclic Inheritance Check**:\n",
    "#     - Write code that checks if a cyclic inheritance structure (a child class eventually inheriting from itself) is accidentally created. Raise an exception if detected.\n",
    "#     - **Hint**: Use the `inspect` module and the `__bases__` attribute of classes to track inheritance chains.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# ---\n",
    "# \n",
    "# ### **5 Real-Life Project Ideas (Apply Inheritance Concepts)**\n",
    "# \n",
    "# 1. **School Management System**:\n",
    "#    - Implement a system with classes like `Person`, `Teacher`, `Student`, and `Administrator`. Use inheritance to share common attributes and methods. Handle complex relationships, like assigning teachers to students and classrooms.\n",
    "#    - **Concepts Covered**: Multiple inheritance, method overriding, polymorphism.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# 2. **E-Commerce Platform**:\n",
    "#    - Create a class hierarchy for products (`Electronics`, `Clothing`, `Food`) that inherits from a base `Product` class. Implement a system to calculate discounts based on the product type, and use inheritance to add specific behavior for each type of product.\n",
    "#    - **Concepts Covered**: Abstract base classes, method overriding, mixins.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# 3. **Vehicle Rental Service**:\n",
    "#    - Design a system where a `Vehicle` is a parent class and `Car`, `Bike`, `Truck` are child classes. Each type of vehicle has its unique rental calculation (price per day, insurance). Create a customer interface that allows them to rent any vehicle.\n",
    "#    - **Concepts Covered**: Inheritance, polymorphism, class and instance attributes.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# 4. **Library System**:\n",
    "#    - Build a library management system where you have classes like `Book`, `Member`, and `Librarian`. Use inheritance to manage different types of books (e.g., E-books, Physical Books) and members (e.g., Students, Faculty). Add features like borrowing, returning books, and fines.\n",
    "#    - **Concepts Covered**: Multiple inheritance, factory pattern, method overriding.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# 5. **Banking System**:\n",
    "#    - Create a class hierarchy for bank accounts (`SavingsAccount`, `CheckingAccount`, `LoanAccount`) that inherits from a base `Account` class. Implement methods for deposit, withdrawal, and interest calculation, with each subclass adding its own special rules.\n",
    "#    - **Concepts Covered**: Abstract base classes, class-level attributes, method resolution order (MRO).\n",
    "# \n",
