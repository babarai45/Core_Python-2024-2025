    "Association is a relationship where all objects have their own lifecycle and there is no owner. Let's take an example of Teacher and Student. Multiple students can associate with a single teacher and a single student can associate with multiple teachers. But there is no ownership between the objects and both have their own lifecycle. Both can create and delete independently."

    "so whenever we create any project we creates lots of classes with differebt names and its differents attributes and methods but each class are connected with each other in some way so that they can perform the task together.\n",
    "so in this relationship we can say that the classes are associated with each other.\n",
    "but these association of classes are not dependent on each other.\n",
    "and its not as class inharitance where one class is dependent on other class.\n",
    "so in association we can say that the classes are associated with each other but not dependent on each other.because it is not accessing all the attributes and methods of other class it is just accessing the required attributes and methods of other class.\n",

    "Let's take an example of a student and a library. A student can issue multiple books from the library. Also, a book can be issued by multiple students. But there is no ownership between the student and the library. Both can be created and deleted independently.\n",

    "# ### Association is two types:\n",
    "# 1. Aggregation (Has-A Relationship) \n",

    "# 2. Composition\n",
    "- it is a strong relationship between the classes like we can say strong association and its compulsory relationship between the classes.\n"
