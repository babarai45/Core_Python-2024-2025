    "### **What is an Abstract Class in Python?**\n",
    "\n",
    "An **abstract class** is a class that cannot be instantiated directly. It is a blueprint for other classes. In Python, we define abstract classes using the `ABC` (Abstract Base Class) module, which is part of the `abc` module. An abstract class typically includes one or more abstract methods that **must be implemented** by any subclass. These abstract methods act as a contract that enforces child classes to provide specific implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why Use Abstract Classes?**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Enforcing Structure**: Abstract classes provide a template for other classes to follow. When designing a complex system, you may want certain classes to have the same set of methods. By using an abstract class, you can ensure that these methods will be implemented in the child classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Common Interface**: Abstract classes ensure that all subclasses provide a consistent interface (same method names and signatures). This is especially useful in large programs where objects of different classes need to interact with each other through the same methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Code Reusability**: Abstract classes can have some implemented methods (non-abstract methods), so child classes can reuse these implementations and focus only on the abstract methods that need to be implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Prevent Direct Instantiation**: You may want to prevent creating objects of a general class that doesn't make sense by itself but is useful when inherited by specific subclasses. For example, it doesn’t make sense to instantiate a \"Shape\" directly because we don’t know its form (circle, square, etc.), but a \"Circle\" or \"Rectangle\" subclass can inherit from \"Shape\" and provide specific details.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **When to Use Abstract Classes?**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Designing a Framework**: When designing a system where you expect future developers to extend classes but follow certain rules, abstract classes are useful. For example, you might create an abstract class for different payment methods in an e-commerce system.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Defining a Template for Subclasses**: Abstract classes are helpful when you want to define a template that all subclasses must follow, ensuring that they implement certain methods. For example, in a game, you might have an abstract class `Player` with abstract methods like `move()` and `attack()`, which every specific player type (e.g., `Warrior`, `Mage`) must implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Forcing Child Classes to Implement Essential Methods**: Use abstract classes when you want to make sure that any subclass **must** implement certain key methods (like in the previous example with `move()` and `attack()`).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Purpose of Abstract Classes**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Promote Consistency**: Ensures that all subclasses will have the same method signatures and are expected to provide implementations of certain methods. This is crucial for consistency when different types of objects interact in a system.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Increase Modularity**: Helps break down complex systems into modular parts where each subclass can provide specific implementations while sharing common behavior from the abstract class.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Improve Extensibility**: When new classes are added to a system, they can inherit from abstract classes, ensuring they adhere to the system's core functionality and structure.\n",

    "### **Example of an Abstract Class**\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a scenario where we have different types of shapes. We might define an abstract class `Shape`, and force every subclass (like `Circle`, `Rectangle`) to implement the `area()` and `perimeter()` methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Code Example**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
    "\n",
    "# Defining the abstract class\n",
    "class Shape(ABC):\n",
    "    # Abstract method (no implementation here)\n",
    "    @abstractmethod\n",
    "    def area(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Abstract method\n",
    "    @abstractmethod\n",
    "    def perimeter(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "# Subclass inheriting from Shape\n",
    "class Circle(Shape):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, radius):\n",
    "        self.radius = radius\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Implementing the abstract method 'area'\n",
    "    def area(self):\n",
    "        return 3.14 * self.radius ** 2\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Implementing the abstract method 'perimeter'\n",
    "    def perimeter(self):\n",
    "        return 2 * 3.14 * self.radius\n",
    "\n",
    "# Subclass inheriting from Shape\n",
    "class Rectangle(Shape):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, length, width):\n",
    "        self.length = length\n",
    "        self.width = width\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Implementing the abstract method 'area'\n",
    "    def area(self):\n",
    "        return self.length * self.width\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Implementing the abstract method 'perimeter'\n",
    "    def perimeter(self):\n",
    "        return 2 * (self.length + self.width)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example of using the subclasses\n",
    "shapes = [Circle(5), Rectangle(4, 7)]\n",
    "\n",
    "for shape in shapes:\n",
    "    print(f\"Area: {shape.area()}, Perimeter: {shape.perimeter()}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "- **Abstract Class (`Shape`)**: We define the `area()` and `perimeter()` methods as abstract using the `@abstractmethod` decorator. This forces any class that inherits from `Shape` to provide its own implementation of these methods.\n",
    "- **Subclasses (`Circle`, `Rectangle`)**: These classes must implement both the `area()` and `perimeter()` methods because they are required by the abstract class.\n",
    "- **Cannot Instantiate `Shape`**: You cannot create an object of the `Shape` class directly because it’s abstract. If you try, Python will raise an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Points to Remember**:\n",
    "1. **Cannot Instantiate**: You cannot create objects of an abstract class directly.\n",
    "2. **Abstract Methods**: Must be implemented by any class that inherits from the abstract class.\n",
    "3. **Why Use It**: Abstract classes enforce a structure and provide a blueprint for future classes, ensuring consistency and improving code maintainability.\n",
    "4. **When to Use**: Use abstract classes when you want to define common behavior across related classes but leave the implementation details to the subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using abstract classes, you can build a strong foundation for systems that are extensible and easy to maintain, ensuring future developers follow a clear and consistent design."
