    "\n",
    "Ensapsulation is one of the four fundamental OOP concepts. The other three are inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation is the technique of making the fields in a class private and providing access to the fields via public methods. It is a protective barrier that keeps the data safe within the class and hides the data from the outside world.\n",

    "**Name mangling** is a mechanism in Python used to make class attributes more secure and to avoid accidental overriding when a class is inherited. Itâ€™s a way Python internally changes the name of a variable or method to make it harder to access them from outside the class, especially for **private** members.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How Name Mangling Works**:\n",
    "- When you define an attribute or method with **double underscores** (`__`) at the beginning of its name in a class, Python automatically modifies its name by adding the class name as a prefix. This makes it harder to access that attribute or method from outside the class, simulating private access.\n",
    "- This name mangling is done internally by Python to prevent accidental access to these variables, especially in the case of inheritance where the subclass might accidentally override the private attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why Use Name Mangling?**\n",
    "- To create **pseudo-private** attributes in Python. Although Python doesn't enforce strict private variables like other languages (e.g., C++ or Java), name mangling provides a level of protection from unintended access or modification.\n",
    "- It helps **avoid accidental conflicts** with names in subclasses when inheritance is involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How to Use Name Mangling (Private Members)**:\n",
    "- To declare a **private** attribute or method, you start its name with **two underscores** (`__`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Test:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.__private_variable = \"This is private\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __private_method(self):\n",
    "        print(\"This is a private method\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    def public_method(self):\n",
    "        print(self.__private_variable)\n",
    "        self.__private_method()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create an object of Test class\n",
    "obj = Test()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accessing private members directly (will fail)\n",
    "# print(obj.__private_variable)  # Raises AttributeError\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calling the public method to access private members indirectly (works)\n",
    "obj.public_method()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accessing private members via name mangling\n",
    "print(obj._Test__private_variable)  # This works (This is private)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "- `__private_variable` is name-mangled to `_Test__private_variable` internally.\n",
    "- Directly accessing `__private_variable` or `__private_method` will raise an `AttributeError`.\n",
    "- However, you can still access it using the mangled name `_Test__private_variable`, but it's discouraged because it goes against the principle of encapsulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Points**:\n",
    "1. **Name Mangling**: Adds a class-specific prefix (e.g., `_ClassName`) to attributes or methods that start with double underscores (`__`).\n",
    "2. **Purpose**: Prevent accidental access or modification of private attributes, especially in the context of inheritance.\n",
    "3. **Access**: You can still access these attributes using their mangled name, but itâ€™s considered bad practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Name mangling is a feature that enhances encapsulation in Python, providing a way to protect class members while allowing flexibility when absolutely necessary."

    "\n",

    "class SecureData:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",

    "If you're dealing with **sensitive data** like passwords or personal information, it's important to store that data securely. One way to achieve this is by using encryption via third-party libraries such as `cryptography` or `pycryptodome`.\n",

    "\n",
    "    def set_password(self, password):\n",
    "        # Encrypt password before storing\n",

    "- **Encryption**: The `Fernet` cipher is used to encrypt the password, ensuring that even if someone gains access to the object, they canâ€™t directly read the password without decrypting it.\n",

    "# export DB_PASSWORD=mypassword\n",
    "db_conn = DatabaseConnection()\n",
    "db_conn.connect()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits**:\n",
    "- Environment variables can be managed securely on different platforms (e.g., cloud services, Docker containers).\n",
    "- Sensitive data is not hardcoded in the application, reducing the risk of exposure.\n",

    "### **4. Using Secret Management Services**\n",
    "\n",
    "For highly secure systems, it's recommended to use **secret management services**. Cloud providers and third-party platforms offer services to securely manage sensitive information like API keys, passwords, and certificates.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **AWS Secrets Manager**: Securely stores and retrieves secrets (e.g., database credentials) from AWS applications.\n",
    "- **Google Cloud Secret Manager**: Centralized secret management in Google Cloud.\n",
    "- **HashiCorp Vault**: Open-source tool for managing secrets, tokens, encryption keys, and other sensitive information.\n",
    "  \n",
    "These services provide:\n",
    "- **Encryption at rest** for secrets.\n",
    "- **Access control** using role-based policies.\n",
    "- **Audit logging** to track access to secrets.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Secure APIs and Authentication**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're dealing with web APIs or user authentication systems, ensure the following:\n",
    "- Use **OAuth2** for token-based authentication (e.g., with libraries like `oauthlib` or `authlib`).\n",
    "- Ensure that sensitive API keys or tokens are stored securely (e.g., using environment variables, secret management, or encryption).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example: Secure API Access Using OAuth2**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from requests_oauthlib import OAuth2Session\n",
    "\n",
    "class SecureAPI:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, client_id, client_secret, token_url):\n",
    "        self.oauth = OAuth2Session(client_id)\n",
    "        self.token = self.oauth.fetch_token(token_url=token_url, client_id=client_id, client_secret=client_secret)\n",
    "\n",
    "    def get_data(self, url):\n",
    "        response = self.oauth.get(url)\n",
    "        return response.json()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage (client_id and client_secret should be stored securely)\n",
    "client_id = \"your-client-id\"\n",
    "client_secret = \"your-client-secret\"\n",
    "token_url = \"https://example.com/token\"\n",
    "\n",
    "api = SecureAPI(client_id, client_secret, token_url)\n",
    "data = api.get_data(\"https://example.com/api/data\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "- OAuth2 is used to securely authenticate and access the API, avoiding the need to expose sensitive tokens or credentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Summary: Securing Sensitive Data in Python**\n",
    "1. **Encapsulation**: Use private attributes with name mangling and control access through getter/setter methods.\n",
    "2. **Encryption**: For highly sensitive data, use libraries like `cryptography` to encrypt data before storing or transmitting it.\n",
    "3. **Environment Variables**: Store sensitive data like API keys in environment variables.\n",
    "4. **Secret Management**: Use third-party secret management services for robust security.\n",
    "5. **API Security**: Use OAuth2 for secure API access and token-based authentication.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods combined will help you build secure, robust Python applications where sensitive data is well-protected."
