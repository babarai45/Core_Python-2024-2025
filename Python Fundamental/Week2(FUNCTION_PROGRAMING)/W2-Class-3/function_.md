# PYTHON Functiona Programming


### what is  Functional?
- A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
- You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.
- A function can return data as a result.
- A function is a reusable block of code that does a specific task.
- it reduces the complexity of the code and makes it easier to understand.
- it makes the code more modular and reusable.
- it devide problem into small parts and solve them individually.
- function is a first class object in python.
- function is reference type in python.
- function can be passed as an argument to another function.
- function can be returned from another function.
- function can be assigned to a variable.
- function can be stored in a data structure.

### Syntax:
```python
def function_name(parameters):
    # code block
    return value
```

### Example:
```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b  # return the sum of a and b
add(10, 20)  # 30  # call the add function or invoke the add function or execute the add function
```

### break down of the function:
- `def`: it is a keyword used to define a function for user-defined function.
- `function_name`: it is the name of the function.
- `parameters`: it is the input to the function.
- `return`: it is a keyword used to return the value from the function it is used only in the function.
- it send the value back to the caller of the function.
- `value`: it is the output of the function.
- if we did not use the return keyword in the function then the function will return None.
- `add(10, 20)`: it is the function call or function invocation or function execution
- if we did not pass any value in return then the function will return None.
