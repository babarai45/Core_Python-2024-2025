    "Let me explain the concept of a **flag** using both a real-life analogy and a step-by-step coding example. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a \"Flag\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, a **flag** is a variable used to indicate the state or condition of something. It's usually a **boolean** value (either `True` or `False`) and is used to track whether a certain condition has been met or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a flag as a simple signal that you \"raise\" or \"lower\" (set to `True` or `False`) based on a specific event or condition during the execution of your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-Life Analogy of a Flag\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're hosting a party. You want to track if all your guests have arrived before you start serving food. Here's how a flag would work in this scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initial Setup (Flag = True)**: \n",
    "   - You assume at the start that everyone will come to the party (you are optimistic), so you set a flag called `all_arrived` to `True`.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Checking Each Guest**:\n",
    "   - As each guest enters, you check them off a list. If one of the guests doesn't arrive (fails to show up), you immediately change your flag to `False`, because now you know **not everyone is there**.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Final Decision**:\n",
    "   - After checking all guests, if the flag (`all_arrived`) is still `True`, it means everyone showed up, and you can serve the food. \n",
    "   - If the flag was set to `False` at any point, it means someone didn't show up, and you'll have to wait or handle the situation differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Programming Example with Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now apply this concept to the student marks example you were working with.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to determine if **all students passed**. If at least one student fails, we want to know that **not all students passed**.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Flag Setup**:\n",
    "   - We start by assuming everyone will pass, so we set a flag (`all_passed`) to `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Check Each Mark**:\n",
    "   - As we go through each student's mark, if we find that a student has failed (i.e., their score is less than 33), we **set the flag to `False`**, because now we know at least one person failed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Final Decision**:\n",
    "   - After checking all the marks, if the flag (`all_passed`) is still `True`, we print \"PASS\". \n",
    "   - If the flag was changed to `False`, we print that \"One or more subjects failed\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how the code would look:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def result(marks):\n",
    "    all_passed = True  # Step 1: We start by assuming all students will pass\n",
    "    \n",
    "    for m in marks:\n",
    "        if m >= 33:\n",
    "            print(\"pass\")\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            print(\"Fail\")\n",
    "            all_passed = False  # Step 2: If any student fails, we change the flag to False\n",
    "            \n",
    "    # Step 3: After checking all marks, we make the final decision based on the flag's value\n",
    "    if all_passed:\n",
    "        print(\"PASS\")  # If the flag is still True, it means everyone passed\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(\"One or more subjects failed\")  # If the flag was set to False, it means someone failed\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start with the flag set to True**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   all_passed = True\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - We assume that all students will pass, so the flag starts as `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **For each mark in the list**:\n",
    "   - If a student's mark is greater than or equal to 33, print \"pass\".\n",
    "   - If a student's mark is less than 33, print \"Fail\" and change the flag to `False`:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     if m >= 33:\n",
    "         print(\"pass\")\n",
    "     else:\n",
    "         print(\"Fail\")\n",
    "         all_passed = False  # This means at least one student has failed\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Check the flag at the end**:\n",
    "   - After going through all the marks, we check the value of the flag:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     if all_passed:\n",
    "         print(\"PASS\")\n",
    "     else:\n",
    "         print(\"One or more subjects failed\")\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - If `all_passed` is still `True`, it means every student passed, so we print \"PASS\".\n",
    "   - If `all_passed` was set to `False`, it means at least one student failed, and we print that someone failed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Execution\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s see how this works with an example input:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "result([20, 40, 33.55])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s what happens step by step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initial Setup**:\n",
    "   - `all_passed = True` (We assume everyone will pass).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **First mark (20)**:\n",
    "   - `20 < 33`, so it prints `Fail`.\n",
    "   - The flag is now set to `False` because at least one person failed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Second mark (40)**:\n",
    "   - `40 >= 33`, so it prints `pass`.\n",
    "   - The flag remains `False` because someone already failed.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Third mark (33.55)**:\n",
    "   - `33.55 >= 33`, so it prints `pass`.\n",
    "   - The flag remains `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Final Check**:\n",
    "   - The flag (`all_passed`) is `False`, so the program prints `\"One or more subjects failed\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Fail\n",
    "pass\n",
    "pass\n",
    "One or more subjects failed\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of Flag Concept:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **flag** is a variable used to track a condition (like whether everyone passed).\n",
    "- You start by assuming one condition (e.g., all will pass).\n",
    "- As you process data (e.g., each student's marks), you check for conditions that might \"lower the flag\" (e.g., someone fails).\n",
    "- After processing, you make decisions based on the final state of the flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a simple but powerful technique to control logic in many programming scenarios."
