    "12. Create a program that prompts the user to enter a number and then prints out the binary representation of that number using a loop and without using any built-in functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. Implement a function that takes a list of strings as input and returns a new list with all the strings that are anagrams of each other grouped together and sorted in alphabetical order.\n",

    "16. Implement a function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list with all the numbers that are perfect cubes using a loop and without using any built-in functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. Write a program that takes a string as input and prints out the string with all the characters in reverse order and all the consonants capitalized using a loop and without using any built-in functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "18. Create a program that prompts the user to enter a number and then prints out the sum of all the numbers in the Fibonacci sequence up to that number using a loop and without using any built-in functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "19. Implement a function that takes a string as input and returns a new string with all the characters in alternating cases and all the vowels removed using a loop and without using any built-in functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "20. Write a program that takes a list of strings as input and prints out the longest string in the list without using any built-in functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "These problems cover various concepts related to Python syntax and variables, such as loops, string manipulation, list operations, conditional statements, and more. They involve using loops, conditional statements, and other Python syntax constructs to solve complex problems without relying on built-in functions or external libraries."
