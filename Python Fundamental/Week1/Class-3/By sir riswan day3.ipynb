    "# Python Variables \n",
    "-   python variable is name to store values \n",
    "-   variable and values can be changed \n",
    "-   value can be any size and any datatype\n",
    "## Why Ask Python is Dynamically Language:\n",
    "-    pyhon is dynamically language because when we assign a value to a variable then we did not assign any data type like(int,float etc.\n",
    "- when python code is run it automatically assign datatype according to value\n",
    "- ``` python\n",
    "  a=5     # python  here is not assign data type\n",
    "  int a=5;  # c++ or static language \n",
    "  ```\n",
    "### Most common 5 types :\n",
    "-   int  or integer (negative or positive values)  \n",
    "-   float or decimal (negative or positive values in points)\n",
    "-   bool or boolean  (0,1 or True or False)\n",
    "-   string or text (\"hello world \")\n",
    "-    complex (1+2j)\n",
    "###### These Above data types also called primitive data types because it stores singles values \n",
    "\n",
    "### Further  divide into five types \n",
    "1.  Numerica datatype(int,float,complex)\n",
    "2.  boolean (bool,true or false)\n",
    "3.  set(set or frozenset)\n",
    "4.  Mapping or dict(dictionary)\n",
    "5. Sequence (list,tuple,range,sting)\n",
    "6. optional None,Bytes,Collection data types \n",
    "\n",
    "#### These data types further divide into 2 :\n",
    "##### - MUTABLE(change able)\n",
    "##### - IMMUTABLE (not change able )\n",
