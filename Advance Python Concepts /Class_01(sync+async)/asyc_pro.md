# Asycronus Programming
- Asynchronous programming is a form of parallel programming that allows a unit of work to run separately from the primary application thread. When the work is complete, it notifies the main thread (as well as whether the work was completed or failed). There are many ways to achieve this result, including callbacks and promises, but one of the most popular methods is the async/await pattern.
- In simple words, Asynchronous programming is a way to improve application performance and responsiveness by allowing tasks to run in the background and not block the main thread.
- More sipmly, Asynchronous programming is  a way to run multiple tasks at the same time without blocking the main thread or waiting for the previous task to complete 
- In Asynchronous programming, the main thread(main program) does not wait for the task to complete, it continues to execute the next task.

# Real Life Senario of Asynchronous Programming by story :
- Suppose you are a teacher and you have 5 students. You have given them a task to solve a math problem. You have given them 5 minutes to solve the problem
- In Synchronous programming, you will wait for each student to complete the task. If the first student takes 2 minutes to complete the task, you will wait for the first student to complete the task and then you will give the task to the second student. This process will continue until the last student completes the task.
- In Asynchronous programming, you will not wait for the first student to complete the task. You will give the task to all the students at the same time. If the first student takes 2 minutes to complete the task, you will give the task to the second student and so on. This way you can save time and complete the task faster.

# An other Real Life Example of Asynchronous Programming  by story :
- Suppose You are Examiner in Examination Hall and you distibute the question paper to all the students in the examination hall. You have given them 3 hours to solve the question paper.
- In Synchronous programming, you will wait for each student to complete the question paper. If the first student takes 2 hours to complete the question paper, you will wait for the first student to complete the question paper and then you will give the question paper to the second student. This process will continue until the last student completes the question paper.
